#1 For this assignment I did not collaborate with anyone, I used notes from previous courses and
I searched for information online.
#2 I do belive I have done the assignment correctly.
#3 Learning how to use fork() properly was a good hurdle to overcome as not properly controlling my process
could lead my program to use up all memory on my machine and fox servers.
